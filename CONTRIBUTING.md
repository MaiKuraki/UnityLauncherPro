## Reporting Bugs

## Suggesting Features

- Open an issue with `[Feature]` in the title
- Describe the problem your feature solves

## Code Style & External Libraries

- Style is not enforced
- Simple code is good and functions can be as long as they need, to do the task (but can extract commonly used parts/methods into Tools or other helper libraries)
- Avoid using external packages/nugets/dependencies (to keep this as a small single exe build)
- Try to keep main features fast (or even improve existing features to make this more lightweight and faster to start etc.)

## Need Help?

Feel free to open an issue or post in discussion.
